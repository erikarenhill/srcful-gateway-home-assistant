This is an Home Assistant custom integration which you setup to read data from your Srcful (srcful.io) gateway.
It will also fetch your gateway serial and read back your own data from the srcful energy-api, such as current power, last seen and todays total production.
It will also provide some statistics for the entire srcful network such as total current power and how many gateways that is online.

Install it through HACS adding this repository as a custom repository, configure it by adding the integration in the UI and provide the IP-address to your gateway.
