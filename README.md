This is an Home Assistant addon which you configure to read some data from your Srcful (srcful.io) gateway.
It will also fetch your gateway serial and get some data from the srcful energy-api back, such as current power, last seen and todays total production.

Install it through HACS adding this repository as a custom repository, configure it by adding the integration in the UI and provide the IP-address to your gateway.
