## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Implement support for multiple Sourceful Energy Zap devices in a single Home Assistant installation, enabling users with multiple smart meters or locations to monitor all devices.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

### 1. Device Management
- [ ] Support multiple device entries through config flow
- [ ] Each device gets unique device ID and name
- [ ] Proper device registry management
- [ ] Device-specific configuration (different IP addresses, scan intervals)

### 2. Entity Naming
- [ ] Unique entity IDs per device to avoid conflicts
- [ ] Device-specific entity naming (e.g., "Zap Kitchen", "Zap Garage")
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with single device setups
- [ ] Clear entity naming convention

### 3. Data Coordinators
- [ ] Separate coordinator instance per device
- [ ] Independent update intervals per device
- [ ] Proper coordinator lifecycle management
- [ ] Error handling per device (one device failure doesn't affect others)

### 4. Configuration Management
- [ ] Multiple config entries support
- [ ] Device-specific options (scan interval, endpoints)
- [ ] Proper config entry cleanup on device removal
- [ ] Config validation per device

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Device Registry Integration
```python
# Each device should have unique identifiers
device_info = {
    "identifiers": {(DOMAIN, f"{device_id}_{config_entry.entry_id}")},
    "name": config_entry.data.get("name", "Zap"),
    "manufacturer": "Sourceful Labs AB",
    "model": "Sourceful Energy Zap",
    "sw_version": firmware_version,
    "configuration_url": f"http://{host}",
}
```

### Entity Naming Convention
- Single device: `sensor.zap_total_energy_import`
- Multiple devices: `sensor.zap_kitchen_total_energy_import`
- Use device name as prefix when multiple devices exist

### Coordinator Management
```python
class SourcefulZapCoordinator(DataUpdateCoordinator):
    """Data update coordinator for a single Zap device."""
    
    def __init__(self, hass, config_entry):
        self.config_entry = config_entry
        self.device_id = config_entry.data["device_id"]
        # Device-specific setup
```

- [ ] Test device removal
- [ ] Test entity naming uniqueness
- [ ] Test independent device operation
- [ ] Test error handling per device
